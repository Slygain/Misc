# Misc
Misc code samples that do what they intend to do

Currently there are 2 varients of the same script.  The script generates the side of a building as a texture at night. It attempts to generate various winows at differing light levels.

TODO: (For texture generator)
* Ensure that the colour generation is not as severe
* Setup some floors to be all on and some off (some buildings only control power for floors rather then rooms)
